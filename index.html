            <p>Hello! My name is Te Ara Erueti and I am from New Zealand.<br>
                I enjoy home workouts, going to the gym, nature walks, wholesome food and spending quality time with
                friends and
                family.<br>
                My favorite areas of fitness include strength training, aerobic dance, cardio and pilates.<br>
                My favorite food dishes to make include pizza, brownies, burgers and fries, home cooked dinners and
                granola smoothie bowls.</p>
            <p>I am a mum to three beautiful children and a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
                My desire to join the Lord's Gospel was to fulfil that eternal yearning that families can together
                forever.</p>
