            <h2>Mosiah 3:5</h2>
            <p>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth,
                who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of
                men,
                and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles,
                such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight,
                and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.

            <h2>Jacob 3:5</h2>
            <p>Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath
                come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the
                Lord, which was given unto our fatherâ€”that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they
                should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.
